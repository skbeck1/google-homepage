This is my first true assignment for The Odin Project. I started this journey in February of 2021 as a way to learn programming (Git, HTML, CSS, Java, short term), with the long term goal of learning Python and SQL.
This project will focus on deconstructing and reconstructing the Google homepage with the intention of learning about code structure.
